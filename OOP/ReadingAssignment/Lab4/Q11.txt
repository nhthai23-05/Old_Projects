- Comparable interface should be implemented in Media class
- We should override it just like we did with Comparator interface approach
- In this approach, we can't have 2 ordering rules since Comparable interface doesn't support this
- We can consider the cases that Media is instance of DigitalVideoDisc class when we define the Compare function.
About its ordering rule, since we can't have 2 ordering rules so we can consider the cases that title is the same,
then the cases that length is the same to sort the order of DVDs.
